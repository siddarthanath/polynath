            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am Siddartha Nath, the founder of PolyNath. 
                    I hold a First-Class Honours in BSc Mathematics with Statistics from Imperial College London (ICL) and a Distinction MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from University College London (UCL). 
                    <br> 
                    I have taken my education and amassed:
                    <ul>
                        <li> 2 years of industry experience, working as a Data Scientist for PayPal, DataSpartan and TurinTech AI. </li>
                        <li> 5 years teaching experience, working as an Academic Mentor, in Mathematics and Computer Science, for Oxford International College.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>What is PolyNath?</h2>
                <p> PolyNath is a comprehensive learning platform, for STEM based subjects, with the support of Generative AI.</p>
                <h2>When was PolyNath created?</h2>
                <p> PolyNath was created in 2020, at the start of the COVID pandemic. However, it was not until 2024, till the website came live.</p>
                <h2>Where was PolyNath created?</h2>
                <p> PolyNath was created from a personal-home-based environment.</p>
                <h2>Why was PolyNath created?</h2>
                <p> PolyNath arose during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, as teaching became online, there had been a notable decrease in student satisfaction and quality learning, 
                As someone who had experienced this, since half of my university experience was remote, I began to question how education was going to transform, post-pandemic. 
                <br> 
                The initial idea of this platform was to create a collective resource bank, on a range of subjects, to which students across the globe would have free access to.
                However, this approach could be problematic if the resources obtained and shared, could not be fully absorbed by users or did not reach a good standard of quality. 
                <br> 
                As a result, I focussed the attention onto creating personalised content, based off of my core strengths - Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. Using my teaching experience as an Academic Mentor, I believe to have 
                perfected the most engaging and accessible way for users to learn content and even teach content to those around them. To support this, I have used my technical background as a Data Scientist, 
                to create a Generative AI learning environment, where people can go and engage directly with Educational-AI models. 
                <br>
